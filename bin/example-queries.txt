	SELECT posts.id, title, posts.time, body, username, sum(vote) AS score FROM posts JOIN users ON (posted_by = users.id) JOIN post_votes ON (posts.id = post_id) WHERE posts.id = 6;

	6|What sharps are in an "A Major" scale?|2016-03-23 23:39:56||hiCarter1|4
	
2)	Produce a table consisting of the titles, post bodies, score (sum of all votes), the username of the user that posted it, and time posted of the 25 most recent posts. (This query will only select posts that have at least 1 vote, but there is a trigger which automatically makes a user upvote his post upon submitting it, and votes are not deleted, instead set to zero) order by latest posted to oldest (order posted not time, so by the auto-increment id)

	SELECT posts.id, title, posts.time, body, username, sum(vote) AS score FROM posts JOIN users ON (posted_by = users.id) JOIN post_votes ON (posts.id = post_id) GROUP BY posts.id ORDER BY posts.id DESC LIMIT 10;
